Take for instance the clue 'Some thought it an ice-breaker!' for TITANIC. There is no standard definition for the answer, but the meaning of the entire clue is intended to point towards it. However, note that some setters use the exclamation mark more as an indication of having come up with (in their opinion) a good or humorous clue."

        <TextView
            android:text="- Think about different ways each word in the clue can be interpreted. 'Spanner' could refer to a tool or a to bridge. 'Layer' could refer to a coating or sheet of material, but could also be describing a bird which lays eggs. 'Tower' is a type of building but also a car pulling a trailer. In this example even the word 'number' can have an unexpected meaning."

This is in contrast to non-cryptic crossword clues which often have several possible answers and force the solver to use the crossing letters to distinguish which was intended."
